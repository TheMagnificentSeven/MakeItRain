"QWOP rain dance"
-goal: perform a ritual/dance(?) to summon rain
-success = call the rain within the time limit
-similar to QWOP controls: four/few keys to control arms/legs
-ragdoll physics
-every level has different instructions
-extreme moves, e.g. "stand on head"
-player is given steps like the Clefairy Game, e.g. left arm/right arm
-possible two player mode: each player uses keys on half the keyboard

~Controls~
-hold key to rotate arm
-jump?
-how to toggle rotation of direction?
-two-player co-op: one person controls arms, one controls legs (removes the "too 
many keys to control" problem) - two buttons per limb, controls direction
-Use xBox controller? (Unity = maybe can't press several keys at once)
-Five controls: move arms, move legs, do handstand

~Commands~
-"move arm three times, then move left leg"
-jump=bend legs, hold and then release
-Simple commands: "move limb", "jump"
-Challenging commands: "stand on head"
-Catch rain in a bowl: first catch the bowl, then have to catch the rain
-"Fight the bear": throw yourself against a bear

~Limit/Risk/How to Lose~
-Time limit (please avoid)
-Land on your head
-Every time you win, things fall from the sky and land on ground, make it harder to
carry out controls
-Can have HP, falling objects deal damage: must finish the dance before you run out of HP

-Don't have joints on limbs in beginning to make it less complicated

~Effects~
-Replace particle textures with sprites? Have random objects raining from the sky

~Game Rules~
-[randomly?] generated steps appear on top of screen for player to follow. Player carries out steps; when they have successfully completed all the steps, they summon a random rain of items. Some items are harmless (baseballs) but some can damage/kill player (anvil) - an arrow appears where it will land and player needs to move out of way or else be damaged (HP is decreased) or killed (game over).
